First things first, red team activities can be insanely valuable at demonstrating specific security weaknesses which you may never have even knew you had. However, the majority of internal testing activies will come back with literally exactly the same finding every single time. 

1) You don't patch you stuff
2) You don't segregate your stuff
3) You don't monitor your stuff

To really get the value out of a comprehensive test you need to make sure that you're not giving the testers an easy ride. The below process shows the basic methodology which an internal test might follow and allows you to remediate this issues before you're told somthing you probably already know (that you don't do 1-3 above). 

Even if you're still in the position when you comission the test it will allow you to have a much more productive scoping discussing with the team you bring in.
